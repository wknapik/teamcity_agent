# Scenario 1: set up 8 agents, with default settings (recommended).
# Agent names will be $fqdn-01 .. $fqdn-08, they will listen on ports 9090 ..
# 9097, will be installed in /home/teamcity/agent/ and a cron entry will be
# added for each to run every 5min and call agent.sh start.
$range = range(1, 8)
teamcity_agent::agent { $range :
    server_url => 'http://example.com/'
}

# Scenario 2: set the agent name and port explicitly.
teamcity_agent::agent { 'foo':
    server_url => 'http://example.com/'
    own_port => 6666,
}

# Scenario 3: set all options explicitly.
teamcity_agent::agent { 'my bar':
    user => 'ci',
    server_url => 'http://example.com/',
    # If you want $name != $agent_name.
    agent_name => 'bar', 
    own_address => '172.16.1.10',
    own_port => 9999,
    properties => 'some.prop = qux',
